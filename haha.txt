Note for first half semester
W07 Inference: Sample Distribution
Estimating SD by range ( a very rough estimate)

Finding sample size n
Recall , notice x- is the error, let it be E. 
Recall confidence interval = mean +/- z*(/n) = mean +/- error = mean +/- E, thus
n=. z=1.96 for 95% confidence.
W08: Hypothesis Testing
Regression
Best model
All X passed test F larger
Correlation
Can only do in simple reg, correlation of X,Y
Use multiple R && sign of coefficient
Multiple R VS R Square
Multiple R = root(R Square)
Correlation of Ybar and Y, i.e., predicted Ys and observed Ys
R Square = SSReg/SSyy == multiple determination (R^2)
What proportion did the model predict correctly
~ var(predicted Y , mean Y) / var(observed Y, mean Y)
Always positive. In simple reg, R square = (correlation)^2
Confidence interval for X coefficient (Q15)
+/- t_value * std_error
SD of Y = SStotal/ dftotal, df total = n(observation) - 1


General
Look at all options becasue option w/ more detail info may show up and is the correct answer!
Q21 Compounded Average Growth Rate
Use (Yt+1 - Yt) / Yt, 
t +4 for quarterly model
t + 12 for yearly model
t + 1 for monthly model
